# Number-Guesser

 This program generates a random number within the given range and allows the
 user to input guesses until they find the correct answer. After every guess,
 the user receives feedback that tells them whether their last guess was lower
 or higher than the correct answer. After the user guesses the number, the range max
 of the generated answer increases by 10 and the range min decreases by 10. There
 are also input fields that allow the user to specify new ranges.
